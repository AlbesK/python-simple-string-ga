# python-simple-string-ga
Simple genetic algorithm written in Python from scratch to evolve a string like "Hello World" from 'dna' of ascii letters and whitespace.

## Example Output:

## Installation

Python3 is needed, no other libraries except the built in ones of math, random and string. (which are imported either way in the program). 

Random check for relative benchmark is included. This was tested with Python 3.6.8 [GCC 8.3.0]

## Usage

I have attached some figure examples with the target word “Hello World!” output.
