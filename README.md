# python-simple-string-ga
Simple genetic algorithm written in python to evolve a string like "Hello World" from 'dna' of ascii letters and whitespace.

## Installation

Python3 is needed, no other libraries except the built in ones of math, random and string. (which are imported either way in the program). Used visual studio code, but I bet jupyter notebook can run it 
as well if you copy paste the code, and then just split the last cell block to the calls of the GA function and random check for relative benchmark. This was tested on Ubuntu 18.04 with Python 3.6.8 (default, Aug 20 2019, 17:12:48) 
[GCC 8.3.0]

## Usage

I have attached in the zip file some figure examples with the words “Welcome to CS547!”(Fig_ex1a,Fig_ex1b) and “Hey!”((Fig_ex2a,Fig_ex2b)), but mainly it can be run on the terminal, else right click with the mouse and press “ Run Python File In Terminal” or however you wish!
